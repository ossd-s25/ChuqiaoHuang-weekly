title: Week 12 - Open Source in Business and Our Group Progress on The Odin Project
---

### How Open Source Helps Business
This week, we learned how open source plays a big role in business. The video I watched and our class discussion helped me to understand that open source doesn’t just impact software—it’s transforming entire industries in a powerful and widespread way.

#### Open Source in Film
I watched the video [*Open Source in Film*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDfD3uvsjtA&list=PLUFGT4sqMUn86VIBg53a3u7y34-lzZQJ8&index=5) and found it really interesting. In the past, film studios used their own tools and didn’t share them in order to stay competitive. That made it harder for studios to work together and slowed down innovation.

However, now with open source, studios build and use shared tools. This helps them focus more on creativity and move faster. In class, we also discussed how this benefits workers—when they move to a new studio, they can keep using the same tools, which makes the transition easier and faster.

Another point I liked was how open source helps students and beginners. Tools like Blender and OpenColorIO are free and open, so anyone can start learning and building skills on their own, even without job experience. That’s a huge advantage for people like us who want to break into the industry.

#### Why OSPOs Matter
I was also interested in the video [*Why Should You Have an Open Source Program Office (OSPO)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYjVwzd7Xrs&list=PLUFGT4sqMUn86VIBg53a3u7y34-lzZQJ8&index=7). At first, I thought OSPOs were just bureaucratic teams that didn’t directly help with a company’s products or profits. But after our class discussion, I now see they are important drivers of innovation. OSPOs help companies use open source in smart, strategic ways—making sure it’s legal, useful, and well-managed.

One key thing I learned is that OSPOs allow companies to work with others, even competitors. By sharing tools and standards, OSPOs help companies to save time, reduce costs and grow faster without breaking any rules. They also help with hiring process since developers are more likely to join a company that values learning, collaboration, and transparency through open source involvement.

### Our group progress on The Odin Project
This week, our group continued making steady progress on The Odin Project by actively joining community discussions and exploring issues we might be able to fix. I’m really happy to see that all our members are engaging with contributors and maintainers and watching closely for any new issues. Everyone is taking initiative by checking both the curriculum and website repositories, and it’s great to see our confidence growing as we understand the project better.

Personally, I joined discussions on four issues and was assigned to two of them. I’ve been checking for new tasks every day and noticed that maintainers are especially active on weekends, so I made sure to engage then. That helped me get tasks involving both content improvement and design accessibility. I also encouraged my group members to review the curriculum from a learner’s perspective. As students, we’re in a great position to notice confusing sections and suggest helpful changes to make the project more beginner-friendly.
