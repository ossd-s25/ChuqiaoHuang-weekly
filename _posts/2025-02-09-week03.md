title: Week 3 - Browser Extension
---


Working with my team on our first Firefox extension, the Virtual Pet, has been an exciting and challenging journey for me. This is the first open source project I have made and it helped me gain a deeper understanding of browser extension while cooperating with my team to bring our idea to life.

### How the idea was born
The inspiration for this project comes from my childhood experience with QQ software, where users could have a cute little penguin on the side of their screen, interacting with it like a virtual pet. I remember how fun it was to see the pet change moods, and it felt like having a little companion while using the computer. 

When I shared this idea with my teammates during our first discussion, they strongly supported it, and we all got excited about making it a reality. However, we didn’t just want to create a fun virtual pet—we wanted it to be useful as well. Our goal was to help users become more aware of their screen time and encourage healthy breaks while browsing. By interacting with the pet and seeing it change moods, users can be reminded of how long they've been online and take breaks to protect their eyes.

### Progress & Achievements
So far, we have made significant progress in developing the core functionality of our Virtual Pet extension. We have written the JavaScript logic that determines the pet’s mood based on when it was last fed and stores this information using Firefox’s storage.local. This ensures that the pet’s state remains persistent even after closing the browser.

Additionally, we have structured the manifest file (manifest.json) to ensure that the extension has the correct permissions and functions properly within Firefox. We have also drafted a README file to document how the extension works and provide instructions for installation.

We are still working on finalizing the visual design of the pet and plan to create an icon for the extension in the next phase.

### Challenges & Problems
One of the biggest challenges is how to implement the pet’s fullness level as a range from 1 to 100 instead of just binary states like "hungry" or "full." Currently, our system changes the pet’s mood based on whether it has been fed in the last 20 minutes, but if we introduce a gradual fullness scale, we need to determine how often the fullness level should decrease and what rate feels natural for users. We also need to decide how feeding affects the fullness level—should feeding instantly reset it to 100, or should it increase incrementally? Managing this dynamically while ensuring smooth storage updates will be a major technical challenge.

Another challenge is defining and implementing a "happy" mood for the pet. Right now, we have conditions for "hungry" and "full," but what determines when the pet is "happy"? Should happiness be based on consistently high fullness levels? Should it be triggered if the user feeds the pet regularly within a certain timeframe? We want the happy mood to feel meaningful, not just an arbitrary state change, so we need to carefully design what conditions influence happiness and how it interacts with other moods.

Additionally, implementing these new mechanics introduces the challenge of balancing complexity and usability. We want the pet to be engaging, but we also don’t want it to become overwhelming or require excessive micromanagement from users. Striking the right balance between interaction and simplicity will be important as we refine our design.

As we move forward, we will focus on finding a structured and intuitive way to track fullness levels, defining clear rules for pet happiness, and ensuring that these features work smoothly within the extension’s logic.

### My Role & Contribution
My primary role in the project has been structuring the codebase to ensure clarity and maintainability. I first organized our repository, making sure we created the necessary files to properly structure and function as a Firefox extension. Since this was my first time working on a browser extension, I researched online and reviewed class materials to understand the basic structure of an open-source browser extension and how to implement it to fit our project’s needs.

After setting up the project’s foundation, I started refining my JavaScript skills, as I hadn’t learned it before. I then wrote structured code using JavaScript for our extension, ensuring that the logic behind pet states and interactions was well-defined.

I also wrote the README file, providing clear documentation on how to install and use the extension, making it easier for others to contribute. Additionally, I organized the HTML file for the extension’s popup, ensuring that the initial framework for the extension was properly set up.

Another key responsibility of mine was working on the manifest file (manifest.json), ensuring that the required permissions and extension settings were correctly defined so that our Virtual Pet runs smoothly in Firefox.

### Surprising discoveries about myself
One of the most surprising things I discovered during this process is how much I enjoy structuring and documenting projects. Writing the README file was something I initially thought of as a simple task, but I realized how important clear documentation is in making an open-source project accessible.

I also found that I enjoy learning new programming languages and frameworks on the go. Initially, I was unfamiliar with JavaScript, but through this project, I became more comfortable writing structured and functional code.

Additionally, I realized that I thrive in roles that involve planning and organizing—whether it’s setting up a codebase, structuring documentation, or ensuring that a project runs smoothly.

### Next Steps
Since we haven’t tested the extension yet, our next major step is testing and debugging to ensure that it works as expected. Once we confirm that the extension functions properly, we plan to add more pet moods such as playful or sleepy, design and create a final pet image and extension icon and add custom reminders to encourage users to take breaks from the screen. Moreover, we can even implement a pet choosing and naming feature to make it more customized for users.
