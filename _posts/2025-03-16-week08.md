title: Week 8 - Reflection on Open Source History and Nick Vidal’s Presentation
---

### Learning About Open Source History and Key Figures
In the first open-source software class this week, I learned about the history of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and important people in the field. I studied Mitchell Baker, who helped create Mozilla Firefox and worked on open-source licenses. Her work made sure the web stayed open and free for everyone.

The person I found most interesting among the key figures we researched in class was Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web. The Web changed how people share and read information online, so I looked up more about him. What surprised me was that he admitted the Web was not a completely new idea. Instead, he described it as a mashup of existing concepts, combining hypertext, the Internet, and multi-font text. This reminded me of how open-source projects work. Many great ideas in technology are improvements on older ideas. Just like Berners-Lee made sure the Web stayed open for everyone, open-source projects let developers from different backgrounds work together to improve technology.

### Insights from Nick Vidal’s Presentation
Nick Vidal, the Head of Community at the Open Source Initiative (OSI), gave us a brilliant presentation in our second class this week. OSI is a nonprofit organization that protects and promotes open-source software by approving licenses and shaping policies.

One of OSI’s key roles is license approval, and I was surprised to learn that it has reviewed and approved over 100 licenses, including well-known ones like GPL and MIT, which we studied in class. Before this presentation, I didn’t realize there were so many different licenses, each with specific rules for how software can be used and shared. To further support organizations in managing open-source licenses, OSI developed ClearlyDefined, a tool that simplifies the process of identifying and resolving licensing issues. This highlights OSI’s commitment to helping organizations choose the right licenses and providing clear guidance for their open-source projects.

Beyond licensing, OSI also works on policy development. Through the Open Policy Alliance, OSI collaborates with governments and nonprofits to create fair and transparent rules for open-source software. Before this presentation, I had no idea how much legal and policy work goes into maintaining the open-source ecosystem, ensuring that it remains accessible and sustainable for everyone.

#### What I learned About Open Source AI
Nick Vidal also spoke about Open Source AI, which completely changed my understanding of what it means for AI to be truly open. Initially, I thought open AI simply meant public code, but I learned that to be recognized as Open Source AI, a system must also have open model weights and data transparency. One of the most surprising things I learned was that without access to model weights, AI remains a black box, making it difficult to understand how decisions are made. This was something I had never considered before.

Another key takeaway was about training data transparency. While AI training data cannot always be fully shared due to privacy laws, listing the data sources can still improve trust and accountability. This balance ensures that AI can be open and responsible while still respecting legal and ethical boundaries.

#### How Open AI Could Help Finance
Before this talk, I hadn’t thought about how open-source AI could impact the financial industry. Many banks and fintech companies use AI for fraud detection, credit scoring, and risk assessment, but closed AI models make these decisions hard to explain. Learning that open AI could make financial systems more transparent changed my perspective. By allowing external experts to review AI models, financial institutions could build fairer, less biased, and more accountable AI systems.

#### Final Thoughts
This presentation changed my view on open-source AI in multiple ways. It’s not just about publishing AI models—it’s about ensuring that AI is accessible, explainable, and fair. I was surprised to learn how much policy and legal work go into defining open-source AI and ensuring transparency. Just like Tim Berners-Lee kept the Web open, open AI should allow everyone to study, improve, and trust the technology that shapes our future.
