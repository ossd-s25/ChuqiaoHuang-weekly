title: Week 14 – Our Group Presentation and Reflections on Others
---

### Our Group Presentation

This week, my teammates and I presented our open source contributions to **The Odin Project** in class. The presentation went smoothly, and we had been preparing our slides since last week. We completed all our pull requests before presenting and even held a mock presentation during one of our group meetings earlier this week.

During the presentation, each team member shared their individual contributions, and it was interesting to see how we all had different perspectives on the project. Personally, I found The Odin Project to be a great starting point for open source contribution. It gave me the chance to get involved, receive support from the maintainers, and build my confidence through real tasks. I ended up making eight pull requests this semester, and most of them were merged. I started with the curriculum repository, which helped me understand the project structure, and later challenged myself by contributing to the more complex website repository. I truly enjoyed working on this project and felt welcomed and supported by its community.

However, my teammate Johnny had a different experience. He felt that it was harder to get meaningful tasks assigned since The Odin Project is already quite mature. He mentioned that many of the maintainers did not respond to his comments, and most of the issues he worked on were small and not very exciting. Despite our different experiences, we all agreed that this project gave us valuable skills, especially in learning how to communicate on GitHub and contribute to a large, active repository. I honestly didn’t expect to gain such hands-on experience from a course like this, and I’m very glad I did.

### Reflections on Other Groups’ Presentations

I also found it really interesting to watch the other groups present this week since each group faced different challenges while working on their open source projects. I enjoyed hearing about their experiences and how they overcame difficulties.

Some groups who worked on **Oppia** said they had trouble setting up the project on their computers. The build process was very slow, so it was hard to write code. Because of that, many of them decided to work on other things like writing content, translating, or reporting issues. I thought it was great how they didn’t give up and still found ways to contribute. Even though the rules were strict and the tests were hard to pass, they kept trying.

The group working on **Mattermost** had a very complete experience. I liked how well-organized their work was. They used special tools to track issues, and even had a server just for contributors. They fixed broken links, improved the design, helped with translations, and learned how to write tests. Even though some tests didn’t work, they kept going. I liked how honest they were about the hard parts, like setting up the iOS app, and how they stayed motivated.

The **Lucide** and **Autogen** groups also had awesome presentations. The Lucide group said they were nervous at first, but they learned a lot from their contributions. The Autogen group had trouble getting their pull requests accepted, but they kept working and made improvements to both the frontend and backend. They also worked on chatbot features, which were new to them. 

Overall, these presentations showed me that each group had a different but meaningful experience. Some worked on code, some translated content, and some learned how to work with the open source community. Through watching the presentations, I learned that open source is not simply about writing code. Instead, open source project is more about teamwork, learning, and finding ways to help. I will definitely keep contributing and growing my skills in the future.
