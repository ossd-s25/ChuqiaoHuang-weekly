## Lessons Learned from the Git Exercise
In the Git exercises we did in the first class this week, we learned the fundamentals of version control with Git and realized how crucial it is to use Git when modifying our work during a project. Git keeps track of the entire project history through branches, enabling us to return to any stage of our work and minimize potential losses. The professor guided us through a complete workflow of working with Git, laying a solid foundation not only for our future contributions to open-source projects but also for our careers in software development.

We started the exercise by initializing a Git repository, committing changes to files and content, viewing the list of commits, and tracking different stages using their IDs. Through these steps, we learned how Git helps protect our work, allowing us to revert to any previous state regardless of mistakes. In a previous class where I learned Git, I knew basic commands but didn't fully understand when and why to commit changes. However, this exercise clarified the importance of committing changes as we modify files and the significance of clear commit messages. This insight will help me maintain a structured and secure workflow in future projects.

Additionally, we practiced restoring accidentally deleted files using git restore, creating and modifying branches, and handling merge conflicts when merging branches. Previously, making changes or deleting files in a project always made me anxious about losing important data. Learning how to restore files and work safely within branches gave me more confidence when refining a project. I now understand how creating branches protects the main codebase and how merge tools can resolve conflicts efficiently.

We also explored commands like git cat-file to visualize how Git stores files and commits, and git diff to compare changes between different commits or branches. I was genuinely astonished by Git's ability to manage code history and facilitate collaboration. These exercises gave me a much deeper appreciation for Git's role in collaborative software development and the confidence to apply these techniques in future projects.

## Reflections on the Presentations and Browser Extensions Created by Other Groups
In the second class of this week, all of our classmates finally presented our first browser extension projects in groups on stage. I had looked through all the teams' project descriptions in their `README.md` before class, but I didn't realize how fun and useful these projects would be when demonstrated in a real browser.

The most useful extension for me was the Unit Converter. This project features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with real-time currency conversion. By implementing it as a browser extension, users can track live currency exchange rates for any region and convert them to their familiar currency. This allows users to view prices in their preferred currency at a glance, which can be incredibly helpful for online shopping and reading economic news and articles. When I first came to the US, I often had to Google the real-time exchange rate between the US dollar and the Chinese yuan or use a calculator to do a rough conversion every time I shopped online. I needed those conversions to compare prices and understand how expensive an item was. If I ever discover a similar extension, I will definitely download it to save time while browsing the internet.

The most interesting project for me was the I Did That Extension, which adds a Donald Trump icon overlay on (whitehouse.gov). The idea of linking a humorous image to a relevant website and mirroring it as it's dragged across the screen is brilliant. It adds a playful, interactive element that keeps users engaged while browsing. Although the extension currently works for only one specific website, I think it would become much more useful if users could customize different images for different websites. Additionally, the extension could be used as a bookmark, helping users track where they left off. This feature would allow users to easily resume reading from the exact point they stopped if they were interrupted.

Moreover, I was surprised to see a different choice of Code of Conduct in a project created by one group that built a Website Time Tracker. While most teams used the [Contributor Convenent](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) we learned about in class, this group adopted a [No Code of Conduct](https://nocodeofconduct.com). Unlike traditional guidelines, this approach provides a brief set of behavioral expectations through a Q&A format to avoid lengthy debates. It acknowledges that contributors are adults who should be responsible for their actions and emotions. This approach minimizes the time spent reviewing repetitive communication guidelines and allows contributors to start collaborating immediately after coming up with an idea.

Admittedly, all the browser extensions built in our class were fascinating and well-structured. The `README.md` files provided clear, step-by-step usage instructions, while the `CONTRIBUTION.md` files outlined specific ways to contribute to each project. These files are essential for open-source projects, helping new contributors quickly understand the project's purpose and functionality. Additionally, the selected Code of Conduct and licenses were carefully chosen to align with each project's goals, making the extensions more accessible and maintainable.

## A biggest take-away from our own group work and from watching other groups
The biggest take-away from our own group was the importance of clear communication and collaboration using Git version control. We realized that consistent commit messages and organized task distribution significantly improved our workflow and minimized confusion. During the process of building our Virtual Pet extension, we encountered challenges such as merge conflicts and data loss due to an unorganized workflow. We overcame these issues by adopting a structured process where each member strictly followed the Git practices we learned in the exercises. Moreover, we implemented a workflow where only one member created pull requests, while the others tested the changes before merging to ensure the extension functioned properly. This approach helped us avoid conflicts, maintain code integrity, and improve overall team efficiency.

From watching other groups, I learned the importance of integrating creativity and user-centric design into an extension project. As extension development becomes increasingly competitive over time, and as people grow more innovative through learning and practice, it is essential to create an extension that not only meets user requirements but also incorporates creative and engaging ideas. In such a competitive market, ongoing contributions and regular updates to the extension are crucial. Collaborating within a small, isolated group is no longer sufficient; instead, listening to others' ideas and tracking consumer needs is key to consistently updating and improving the project, making it more sustainable in the long run.

By reflecting on the feedback we received for our group project and observing other groups' presentations, I realized that our project, which I initially thought was nearly perfect, still has room for improvement. For example, we could better integrate user requirements by adding features like screen time tracking or providing useful information to users while they browse. These improvements would make our extension more competitive and user-friendly. Through this experience, I also recognized that software development is not just about writing code; soft skills like collaboration, communication, and project management have become equally important in todayâ€™s development landscape.
