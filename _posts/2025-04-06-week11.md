### Contributing to The Odin Project: Progress and Goals
Over the past few weeks, our group has been working on contributing to The Odin Project as part of our open-source group project. We’ve each made small but meaningful contributions by creating pull requests on The Odin Project’s curriculum and website repositories.

One of my contributions involved rewriting the instructions for an assignment on binary trees. The original wording didn’t clearly explain what makes a binary tree “balanced,” which could confuse learners. I rewrote the instruction to make it clearer and easier to follow. Through this process, I learned that the maintainers are very detail-oriented, especially when it comes to grammar and formatting. I had to revise my changes several times to meet their standards, which helped me improve my technical writing skills.

I also submitted a pull request suggesting the addition of a video tutorial on Git version control. The video explains how to use Git branches, which I think would really help beginners who are new to version control.

Another contribution I made was through their website repository. There was an open issue asking for a change in the study path related to Node.js. To address this, I had to set up the entire development environment, which runs on Ruby on Rails. As someone new to Ruby, I spent time learning the basics of the language to make sure I could contribute effectively. This experience not only helped me understand the structure of the site but also gave me a good introduction to a new programming language and framework.

Looking ahead, I’m planning to contribute a new course section on unit testing with Mocha and Chai for the JavaScript learning path. I’d like to start with an introduction to why testing is important, then move on to how assertions work and how to use testing tools like Mocha and Chai effectively. I hope this addition can give learners a better understanding of how to write more reliable and maintainable code.

### Presentation by Shivam Balikondwar
This week, Shivam gave a great presentation in class about his journey in the world of open-source software. What really stood out to me was that he didn’t even study computer science in his undergraduate degree, yet he was still able to consistently contribute to big projects like Firefox and Chromium. His presentation clearly showed that you don’t always need a degree or years of experience to get involved in open source. Instead, curiosity, patience, and a willingness to learn are what truly help people who are interested in programming to keep growing in the world of software engineering.

Shivam explained how open source is a great way to practice coding skills, even for beginners. He used Firefox as an example to show how people with different skills—like Python, Rust, C++, or even design and translation—can all find ways to contribute. That made me feel a lot more confident about exploring open-source projects myself.

He also shared a helpful website (https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/#projects_all) where we can apply to join open-source projects and learn from mentors. I didn’t know programs like this existed before, and now I’m excited to check them out. The good news is that I’ve already applied to two of the projects on this website after his presentation!

Overall, Shivam’s presentation helped me realize that there are many different paths in tech, and open source is one of them. His talk encouraged me to keep learning and reminded me not to give up just because something seems hard at first.
