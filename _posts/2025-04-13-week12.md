### The Cathedral and the Bazaar essay with our group contribution
Raymond’s essay discusses two main ways to build software. The first one is the **Cathedral model**, where only a few people are in charge and plan everything carefully. The second one is the **Bazaar model**, which opens the project to everyone, allowing many people to contribute small changes over time.

Both models have their strengths and can be seen in modern open source projects. The Odin Project, which our group is contributing to, is mostly like a Bazaar because it welcomes contributions from users around the world. This helps the project grow and improve quickly. However, it also includes elements of the Cathedral since maintainers review and assign issues and pull requests to keep the project organized.

Here are two key ideas from the essay, and how we saw them in our group’s work on The Odin Project:

#### "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."
This famous quote still holds true today. It means that the more people look at a project, the easier it is to find and fix bugs. In The Odin Project, many contributors are also learners who go through each lesson carefully. As a result, they often spot broken links or confusing explanations before the maintainers do. It’s common to see a GitHub issue opened by a user right after finishing a lesson, followed quickly by a pull request or helpful comments from others.

#### "To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you."
This idea really resonated with me. Most contributors to The Odin Project care about web development, and they fix things they notice during their own learning. Our group felt the same way. Even though we were unfamiliar with the codebase at first, our interest in the topic motivated us to keep going. Fixing real issues while learning made the experience more meaningful.

One thing I worked on was a confusing lesson about binary trees. I didn’t write new content from scratch—I found better wording from a similar lesson and adapted it. This made the lesson easier to understand and consistent in style. The maintainers were very careful about phrasing and asked me to revise it several times, which I found helpful.

### Claude Warren’s Coffeehouse Idea
Claude Warren introduces a third model—the **Coffeehouse**—to describe open source collaboration. It’s not as strict as the Cathedral or as chaotic as the Bazaar. Instead, it’s a creative, relaxed space where people talk, share, and build together.

This idea fits my experience with The Odin Project. For example, I worked on an issue about balanced binary trees, which was raised by another contributor and discussed openly on GitHub. After I shared my draft, both contributors and maintainers gave thoughtful feedback. It didn’t feel like a solo assignment; it felt like a group effort where everyone was trying to make the lesson better.

Even for smaller PRs, maintainers and other contributors jumped in with suggestions, often explaining why something worked or didn’t. The project became more than just a place to write code—it became a space to share ideas and grow together. That’s exactly what the Coffeehouse model describes: a healthy, informal collaboration environment that supports both beginners and experienced developers.

### OSPO in Companies
In Claude Warren's talk, Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) serve as a solution to bridge the structured "Cathedral" model and the free-form "Bazaar" model.
OSPOs help teams work together in open source while still following the company’s rules and goals. They also make sure open source tools are used responsibly and that companies give back to the community.

At [Google](https://opensource.google), the OSPO includes researchers, legal experts, and managers. They help employees contribute correctly, follow open source rules, and support large projects like TensorFlow and Kubernetes. They also research how open source works to improve how Google engages with it.

At [Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com), the OSPO helps teams use and contribute to open source safely. They run training, set internal policies, and manage the FOSS Fund, which donates money to open source projects nominated by employees. Since Microsoft owns GitHub, their OSPO also helps developers contribute directly and easily.

These OSPOs are important because they build trust, make sure rules are followed, and help open source projects stay strong and healthy.
