title: Week 2 - Code of conduct
---


A code of conduct is a document written to provide guidelines and rules for contributors of an open source project. The presentation [“How to Drive Consensus and Transparency Within Open Source Communities”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYwTDNA3Uac) emphasizes the importance of having clear and transparent community guidelines. This support for a code of conduct is based on its role in building a healthy, welcoming community that motivates participation. In this week's study, we first looked at the [Go project's code of conduct](https://go.dev/conduct) to understand the general structure and purpose of such documents. The Go project's code of conduct outlines both the expected behaviors and the unacceptable conduct for community members. By providing this document, the Go project ensures that contributors from diverse cultures and backgrounds feel secure and welcome, thereby fostering an environment that emphasizes respect and collaboration. Defining acceptable versus unacceptable behavior—and providing mechanisms for addressing violations—minimizes misunderstandings and creates a space where healthy debate and diverse opinions can thrive.

The Go project's code of conduct is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct), yet two noticeable differences stand out when comparing the two versions. Firstly, the Go project’s version is more casual and concise. While the Contributor Covenant serves as a general template with an inclusive tone and broad standards applicable to many types of projects, the Go version tailors its language to reflect the community's historical values and technical focus. It begins by clearly stating the three main goals of the Go project, ensuring that contributors share a common understanding of the project’s mission. This is followed by an informal presentation of the "Gopher values," which contributes to a relaxed yet professional atmosphere. In doing so, the document clearly signals that the project is committed to creating a friendly and safe environment for all contributors. Secondly, the Go project’s code of conduct specifies an internal process for conflict resolution rather than relying solely on a generic external framework. The document encourages contributors to address issues directly and resort to involving a project maintainer only if direct resolution proves unsuccessful. This approach contrasts with the Contributor Covenant, which outlines strict guidelines and enforcement responsibilities for community leaders. The Go version’s emphasis on negotiation and community-driven resolution is a better fit for its values and working style, highlighting a preference for internal consensus over formal arbitration.

Another illustrative case is the [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) [Code of Conduct](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php), as featured on the Contributor Covenant website. Compared to Go’s version, Eclipse’s code of conduct places greater emphasis on legal and formal aspects of behavior. Given that Eclipse’s community includes a broad range of stakeholders with diverse technical backgrounds, the document explicitly addresses not only internal behavioral standards but also external legal obligations. This more formal approach helps manage the complexity of Eclipse’s larger and more varied community, ensuring that all participants understand the legal and ethical framework governing their interactions.

In contrast, the [Sugar Labs](https://www.sugarlabs.org) project has a [code of conduct](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Legal/Code_of_Conduct)—though influenced by the Contributor Covenant template—is noticeably less formal than Eclipse’s document. Sugar Labs places greater emphasis on articulating specific community values, reflecting its identity as a smaller, tighter-knit community. This tailoring underscores how open source projects modify the Contributor Covenant to suit their unique cultural contexts, goals, and community sizes.

For a final perspective, I looked at the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) project’s [code of conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Node.js, like Go, modify the Contributor Covenant to fit its community’s needs. Node's version successfully balance between formal disciplines and a friendly tone. The Node.js version clearly illustrates the expected behavior standard of contributors and provides a transparent process for conflict resolution, which involves a dedicated team of community moderators. This structure not only underscores the importance of respectful collaboration but also ensures that decisions regarding enforcement are made transparently and fairly. By combining clear guidelines with an emphasis on open, community-driven conflict resolution, Node.js reinforces its commitment to a safe and inclusive environment for both new and experienced contributors.

All the examples we have discussed above highlight a key point from the presentation [“How to Drive Consensus and Transparency Within Open Source Communities”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYwTDNA3Uac): transparency in decision-making builds trust within communities. A concise set of guidelines and a clear procedure for addressing conflicts empower contributors to understand how decisions are made, how they are protected, and how they can participate meaningfully. Moreover, driving consensus is about listening to all voices and respecting every contributor’s ideas and suggestions. The tailored approaches seen in these code of conduct documents reflect each project’s unique values, technical focus, and community size, thereby creating supportive environments that encourage both collaboration and innovation.

To conclude, while many open source projects start with a common template like the Contributor Covenant, the modifications they make illustrate how deeply community values shape their operational practices. A code of conduct is never just about enforcing the rules in an open source project, it is more about creating a transparent, respectful and inclusive environment that arouse sustainable development and fosters trust among contributors.
