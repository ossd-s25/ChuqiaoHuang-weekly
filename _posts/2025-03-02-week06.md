title: Week 6 - Reflecting on My Small Contributions to Open Source
---


Over the past few weeks, I have had the opportunity to make small but meaningful contributions to Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, and GitHub. These experiences, while seemingly minor, have given me a deeper appreciation for how open knowledge platforms function and how even the smallest edits can have a real impact. Each contribution challenged me in different ways, pushing me to navigate platform guidelines, troubleshoot unexpected issues, and become more observant of my surroundings.

### Improving Wikipedia Pages: Overcoming Formatting Challenges
My first contribution was on Wikipedia, where I focused on improving the formatting of my high school’s page. Before making any changes, I carefully read through Wikipedia’s editing guidelines to ensure that my modifications aligned with the platform’s standards. I noticed that my school’s page was poorly formatted, making it difficult to read, so I took the initiative to restructure the layout for better clarity and consistency.

However, I faced a frustrating challenge—while working on the update, my Wikipedia account was unexpectedly logged out, causing my edits to be recorded under my IP address rather than my username. This meant that my contribution was not linked to my account, leaving no personal record of my efforts. While this was discouraging, I took it as a lesson to always check my login status before making edits. I later returned to the page, ensured I was properly signed in, and updated the most recent information from the school’s official website. This experience taught me the importance of attention to detail and persistence, even in seemingly straightforward tasks. 

### Adding Missing Locations to OpenStreetMap
My second contribution was to OpenStreetMap, inspired by my professor’s suggestion that meaningful contributions can often be found in our daily lives. This made me more aware of my surroundings, as I actively looked for places that were missing from the map.

Initially, I found it challenging to locate areas that needed updates, particularly in New York City, where OpenStreetMap is already highly detailed and frequently updated. However, an opportunity arose during my trip to Los Angeles, where I visited my boyfriend. While searching for a convenience store, I realized that the store we visited was not listed on the map. Seizing the opportunity, I added its details and exact location to OpenStreetMap. This small contribution made me appreciate how crowdsourced mapping platforms rely on individual contributions to stay accurate and up to date.

### Submitting My First Open Source Recommendation on HelloGitHub
The contribution I am most proud of is my project recommendation on HelloGitHub, a Chinese open-source project discovery platform that helps developers—especially beginners—find interesting and useful open-source projects.

During this week’s project evaluation, I came across The Odin Project, an open-source learning platform that provides free resources for web development. As someone currently taking two web application courses this semester, I found this project particularly relevant and valuable. I am familiar with the technologies used in web development, and I am eager to expand my knowledge in this area. To help more Chinese learners discover and benefit from The Odin Project, I decided to write a project recommendation and submit it to HelloGitHub.

This contribution was especially meaningful because it was the first issue I opened on an open-source project. I took the time to carefully read through HelloGitHub’s formatting requirements, ensuring that my submission met their standards. Unlike my previous contributions, which involved direct edits to existing content, this task required me to craft a well-structured recommendation that effectively conveyed the value of The Odin Project to potential learners. This experience deepened my understanding of GitHub’s issue tracking system and gave me a sense of accomplishment in engaging with the open-source community.

### Lessons Learned and Next Step
These contributions, though small, have broadened my perspective on open knowledge and collaboration. Through Wikipedia, I learned the importance of proper formatting and account management. OpenStreetMap made me more attuned to the gaps in publicly available data and how I can help fill them. Contributing to HelloGitHub allowed me to engage with an open-source community for the first time, pushing me to follow structured submission guidelines and think critically about how open-source projects are shared and promoted.

Moving forward, I aim to continue contributing to open-source projects on GitHub, with a particular focus on exploring beginner-friendly issues in repositories that interest me. In addition, I plan to delve deeper into coding contributions, using this journey as an opportunity to enhance my skills and refine my expertise. This experience of making small contributions to open-source projects has reinforced the idea that anyone can contribute to open knowledge, regardless of their technical background. Even the smallest edits play a role in improving the accessibility and accuracy of information, and I am excited to continue making meaningful contributions in the future.
